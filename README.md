# OpenBCI_32bit_Libraries

To use these librareis with the OpenBCI 32bit Board, download the zip, or clone the repo, and move the folders 'OBCI_SD' and 'OpenBCI_32_Daisy' into your

    User/Documents/Arduino/libraries

folder. If you don't have a 'libraries' folder in your Arduino sketch folder, go ahead and make one.
